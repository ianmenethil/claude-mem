‚ö†Ô∏è  Claude-Mem: First-Time Setup

Dependencies have been installed in the background. This only happens once.

üí° TIPS:
   ‚Ä¢ Memories will start generating while you work
   ‚Ä¢ Use /init to write or update your CLAUDE.md for better project context
   ‚Ä¢ Try /clear after one session to see what context looks like

Thank you for installing Claude-Mem!

This message was not added to your startup context, so you can continue working as normal.
